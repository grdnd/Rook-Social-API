# Homework 18: Social Network API: Rook-Social-API

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Rook-Social-API is a simple social network API that utilizes multiple technologies that modern full-stack applications use today. Routing for our server is handled by `Express.js`, while the `Mongoose` ODM library models our `MongoDB` data. With this social network API, we add/edit/delete Users on our network, interact with other user thoughts with reactions, or even add and delete friends from our friend list.

## Installation

In order to install this application:

First, open this application along with your terminal and run `npm init` to initialize a new npm package

Proceed with `npm i` to install our dependencies. <br>
More specifically:

    npm i express mongoose nodemon dotenv


## Usage

Once we have our dependencies successfully installed, we can now start the server.

Running any of the following commands will have our server listening to port:

    npm start / npx nodemon / node server.js

### User Story

    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
